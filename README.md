I'm using here bayesian inference to find expected probability of one inductive argument "no wedding ring -> not married":<br />
 **P(not married | no ring & my data) = 62% ±14%** <br />
In other words, given the data I have, if one sees that a person has NO wedding ring, one should rationally expect that this person is NOT married with only 62% confidence level. <br />
Prior distributions are such, that prior expectation of this probability is: <br />
**P(not married | no ring) = 96% ±11%** <br />
Hence, my analysis falsifies the hypothesis, that this inductive argument is accurate.<br />

Here's a little article of mine, describing what data I use and some basic logic of how it's connected to the probabilities I estimate
