I'm using here bayesian inference to find expected probabilities of 2 inductive arguments:
P(not married | no ring) = 61%
P(married | ring) = 89%
In other words if one sees that a person has NO wedding ring, one should rationally expect that this person is NOT married with only 61% confidence level.
And if one sees that a person has wedding ring, one should rationally expect that this person is married with 89% confidence level.

here's a little article, describing what data I use
and some basic logic of how it's connected to the probabilities I estimate
