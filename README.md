I'm using here bayesian inference to find expected probabilities of 2 inductive arguments:<br />
 **P(not married | no ring) = 61%** <br />
 **P(married | ring) = 89%** <br />
In other words, given the data I have, if one sees that a person has NO wedding ring, one should rationally expect that this person is NOT married with only 61% confidence level. <br />
And if one sees that a person has wedding ring, one should rationally expect that this person is married with 89% confidence level.<br />

Here's a little article of mine, describing what data I use and some basic logic of how it's connected to the probabilities I estimate
